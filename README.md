# Marketing-Analytics-Toolkit

# **Overview**

This repository contains a Marketing Analytics Toolkit designed as a practical reference for internships and early-career roles in analytics, consulting and marketing strategy. The toolkit explains four core analytical frameworks used in data-driven marketing decision-making, focusing on how they work and how managers use them. Rather than presenting code-heavy analysis, this project emphasizes conceptual clarity, managerial relevance and strategic application.

# **Purpose of the Toolkit**

Modern marketing decisions rely on multiple analytical perspectives. This toolkit serves as a compact, structured guide to help practitioners:

- Select the right analytical method for a business problem

* Understand assumptions and limitations of each model

+ Translate analytical outputs into actionable decisions

# **Analytical Tools Covered**

## **Cluster Analysis**

# What it is:
A segmentation technique that groups customers based on similarity in behaviors or preferences.

How it works:
Uses distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) and algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering to create internally cohesive and externally distinct groups.

Managerial use:

Customer segmentation and targeting

Personalised messaging and promotions

Resource allocation across high-value and low-value segments

2. Choice Models

What they are:
Predictive models that estimate the probability of a customer choosing one option over another.

How they work:
Typically implemented using multinomial logit models, linking choice outcomes to product attributes such as price, brand, or delivery speed.

Managerial use:

Pricing and promotion optimisation

Product positioning decisions

Assessing impact of removing or adding product options

3. Conjoint Analysis

What it is:
A preference-based technique used to measure how customers value different product attributes.

How it works:
Customers evaluate or choose between product profiles, allowing estimation of trade-offs and willingness to pay.

Managerial use:

Product and feature design

Competitive positioning

Bundle creation and pricing strategy

4. Market Response Models

What they are:
Models that quantify how marketing inputs affect business outputs such as sales or market share.

How they work:
Often implemented using linear or log-linear regression on time-series or panel data.

Managerial use:

Marketing budget allocation

ROI optimisation

Sales forecasting and campaign planning

Key Skills Demonstrated
